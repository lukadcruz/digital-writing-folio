### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- Long form fiction
- Creative non-fiction
- Film reviews
- Short form fiction

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- When writing, I typically use word processing programs on a laptop as my primary tool, and on occasion I will use my phone as well. I tend to shy away from using handwritten forms of writing. My techniques of writing are rudimentary; there is often a very minimal amount of formatting, deviations from standard paragraph text or use of external components such as images or audio. I tend to write either at home or when commuting. Listening to ambient music or film scores often helps my focus when writing. When researching, I use the internet for most queries.

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Primarily, I use these tools for convenience. Word processing programs allow my to type at a rate much faster than I can write with my hand, and using my phone enables me to draft notes and write spontaneously due to the portability of the device. The techniques I implement are mostly out of habit, as I find it most comfortable when my writing takes focus and the medium is utilised in a minimal way or does not call much attention to itself.

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- While I am most comfortable in the current patterns that I follow, I believe that my writing can at times be constrained by my adhereance to rigid form. It is effective in facilitating my writing to bring focus to the words, however I believe experimenting with different tools could enable me to actualise my writing to better effect. My environment may also constrain the way I write, as during commutes I am often writing under loose time restrictions, though it can sometimes be beneficial to write with an external pressure. I could use more audiovisual content as research, as well as accessing books and other library resources to further solidify the breadth of my research. 

## Week 3
Defining Electronic Literature

Edit the 'exercises.md' page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
- How are those elements meaningful?
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
