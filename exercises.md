### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- Long form fiction
- Creative non-fiction
- Film reviews
- Short form fiction

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- When writing, I typically use word processing programs on a laptop as my primary tool, and on occasion I will use my phone as well. I tend to shy away from using handwritten forms of writing. My techniques of writing are rudimentary; there is often a very minimal amount of formatting, deviations from standard paragraph text or use of external components such as images or audio. I tend to write either at home or when commuting. Listening to ambient music or film scores often helps my focus when writing. When researching, I use the internet for most queries.

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

- Primarily, I use these tools for convenience. Word processing programs allow my to type at a rate much faster than I can write with my hand, and using my phone enables me to draft notes and write spontaneously due to the portability of the device. The techniques I implement are mostly out of habit, as I find it most comfortable when my writing takes focus and the medium is utilised in a minimal way or does not call much attention to itself.

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

- While I am most comfortable in the current patterns that I follow, I believe that my writing can at times be constrained by my adhereance to rigid form. It is effective in facilitating my writing to bring focus to the words, however I believe experimenting with different tools could enable me to actualise my writing to better effect. My environment may also constrain the way I write, as during commutes I am often writing under loose time restrictions, though it can sometimes be beneficial to write with an external pressure. I could use more audiovisual content as research, as well as accessing books and other library resources to further solidify the breadth of my research. 

## Week 3
Defining Electronic Literature

Edit the `exercises.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
- How are those elements meaningful?
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
  
  ## Taroko Gorge:
  The physical structure of the poem (the formatting of the lines give guidance to the way in which the poem is read)
  The words themselves create meaning but also the presentation of the words; because the poem is generative, the words flow downwards on screen as more lines are added, thus mimicking the river flow in which the words often relate to. Looking at remixes of the work we can see that the downward flow of words has a different effect if the words themselves are changed. The remix 'Gorge' evokes notions of digestion as the words themselves force us to reconsider what the particular feeling the presentation evokes. As it is a generative poem, lines flow underneath each other in constant momentum, forcing the reader to keep up to the pace of the work itself as the poem builds itself unrelentingly. In print literature, the pace of the poem would be easier decided by the reader rather than dictated by the work, as there is no programmed quality in print literature to generate text, thus the structure of the piece would have to operate in a different manner.

  ## The Gathering Cloud:
  The Gathering Cloud features highlighted words that when hovered over expand to reveal more text. It is in this way that we understand the red highlighted text to be read. The presentation of the page also features elements that are read intrinsically to the form; the array of text orients the reader to different areas of the screen and compels the reader to consider the text in relation to the supplied images. The author also uses animation and image movement to direct the readers eye, often mimicking the evocation of the text (the scale of the elephant images growing with urgency as the text describes the scale of clouds growing with urgency). The relationship between image and word works towards defining the overall metaphor of a progression of the cloud. The images often have a disregard for overlapping the words or for remaining in the borders which also further strengthens what the author is communicating in terms of scale. The key factor differing The Gathering Cloud from a work of print literature is its use of animation, an digital element that would require an analog solution such as a flipbook or a pop-up book technique to be read in a similar way in print. As the animation is used without pause, The Gathering Cloud conveys a sense of urgency to its images that is intrinstic to it being electronic.

  ## First Draft of the Revolution:

  ## Shade:
  

  ## How is electronic literature different from print literature?
  
Electronic Literature allows for a more urgent sense of interactivity than print literature as well as opportunity to introduce more multi-disciplinary elements than possible with print. This could be typified by (including but not limited to) use of animation, generative text, user response/feedback or choice, which can be achieved in print literature (ie Choose your Own Adventure book) but not with the same pace of urgency as through electronic means. In this sense electronic literature can force the reader to implicate themselves in the works they are engaging with if there are choices that exercise their agency or complicity, or give them to power to change the course of the narrative itself.


- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
